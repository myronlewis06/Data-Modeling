# Data-Modeling

This repository contains Python code designed to create multiple tables from a single flat file, converting it into a star schema format. The purpose of this code is to facilitate efficient data organization and improve query performance.

Before using the code, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of star schema concepts and the structure of your data. This foundational knowledge will help you effectively utilize the code for your specific needs.

I have tested this code with my dataset and achieved a significant data size reduction of 80 to 85%. The code performs optimally as long as the column names and the number of columns remain consistent.
